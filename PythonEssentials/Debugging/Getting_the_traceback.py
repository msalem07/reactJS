#
#   When Python encounters an error, it produces a treasure trove of error information called the traceback. The
#   Traceback includes the error message, the line number of the line that caused the error, and the sequence of the
#   function calls that led to the error. This sequence of calls is called the call stack

import traceback

try:
    raise Exception("this is the error message.")
except:
    errorFile = open('errorInfo.txt', 'w')
    errorFile.write(traceback.format_exc())
    errorFile.close()
    print('The traceback info was written to errorInfo.txt.')
